## Key Features

### **1. Default Suggestion**

* Users can add default suggestions that serve as the initial response options for the chatbot.

* Each suggestion can be edited or deleted as needed.

* Example: *“Who is Sreerag?”*

### **2. Suggestions**

* Suggestions allow the chatbot to provide additional response options based on user queries.

* Each suggestion consists of two parameters:

  * **User Input (Suggestion):** The phrase or question the user might ask.

  * **Bot Response:** The chatbot's reply, which can either be manually defined or automatically generated using AI based on the trained context.

* Users can add multiple suggestions and connect them to other nodes.

* Example: *User asks: “How can I contact him?” → Bot responds: “You can reach him via email at* [*support@example.com*]()*.”*




<Tip>
  Each suggestion has two parameters suggestion itself and bot response, you can define the bot response or let ai handle it based on your trained context
