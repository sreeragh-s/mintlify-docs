## Quickstart Guide: Setting Up Your Chatbot

Follow these simple steps to get your chatbot up and running on your website in minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Your Domain">
    Before embedding your chatbot, you need to specify the domain where it will be used. This ensures your chatbot operates securely and only on authorized websites.

    1. Navigate to the Dashboard in your \[Your SaaS App Name] account.

    2. Under the Setup section, click on Configure your domain.

    3. Enter your website’s domain (e.g., example.com) and configure the necessary DNS settings as prompted.

    4. Once configured, you’ll see a checkmark indicating your domain is set up correctly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Your Embed Script">
    To add your chatbot to your website, you’ll need to embed a script. This script will load your chatbot seamlessly into your site.

    1. In the Setup section, locate the Get your embed script option.

    2. Copy the provided embed script by clicking the Copy button. The script will look something like this:

    ```javascript
    <script>
        let chatFrameId = localStorage.getItem('chatFrameId');
        if (!chatFrameId) {
            chatFrameId = 'cf-' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);
            localStorage.setItem('chatFrameId', chatFrameId);
        }

        const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
        const iframeStyles = (styleString) => {
            const style = document.createElement('style');
            style.textContent = styleString;
            document.head.append(style);
        }

        iframeStyles('.chat-frame {
            position: fixed;
            bottom: 20px;
            right: 20px;
            border: none;
        }');

        iframe.src = "https://app.bizmo.chat/chatframe";
        iframe.classList.add('chat-frame');
        document.body.append(iframe);

        window.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
            if (e.origin === "https://app.bizmo.chat") return null;
            let dimensions = JSON.parse(e.data);
            iframe.width = dimensions.width;
            iframe.height = dimensions.height;
            iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({
                type: "INIT",
                id: {your-chatbot-id},
                chatFrameId: chatFrameId
            }, "https://app.bizmo.chat");
        });
    </script>}
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title=" Paste this script into the <head> section of your website's HTML code" />
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Once the script is added, your chatbot will appear on your website. Customize your chatbot’s appearance, behavior, and responses in the Dashboard to match your needs. If you encounter any issues, refer to our troubleshooting guide or contact our support team.
