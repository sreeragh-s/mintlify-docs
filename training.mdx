&#x20;This guide focuses exclusively on navigating and using the "Training" section, as shown in the provided UI screenshot. Follow these instructions to effectively train your chatbot and optimize its performance.

## Overview of Training Sources

The Training section of Bizmo.chat allows you to equip your chatbot with knowledge by integrating various data sources. These sources—Text Input, Document Upload, and Website Data—enable you to create a comprehensive knowledge base tailored to your website’s needs. Each method offers unique benefits and is suited for different types of content, ensuring flexibility and precision in training your chatbot.

## &#x20;Text Input

Text Input is a straightforward method for manually adding custom knowledge directly into Bizmo.chat. It’s ideal for concise, specific information such as FAQs, product descriptions, or key business details.

### Purpose

Use Text Input to provide targeted, text-based knowledge that your chatbot can use to answer user queries.

This method is perfect for small amounts of content or when you want to manually curate the exact information your chatbot should learn.

### **Process**

##

### Best Practices

* **Keep It Concise:** Limit text to essential, relevant information to avoid overwhelming the system and ensure clarity for the chatbot.

* **Use Clear Language:** Write in simple, conversational language that mirrors how users might ask questions.

* **Organize by Topic:** Group related information (e.g., all FAQs, all product details) to improve the chatbot’s ability to categorize and respond accurately.

* **Avoid Redundancy**: Remove duplicate or overlapping content to stay within character limits and maintain efficiency.

### Troubleshooting

* **Character Limit Exceeded:** If you exceed the 10,000-character limit, reduce or condense the text, or split it into multiple submissions.

* **Text Not Processing:** Ensure the text isn’t empty or contains special characters/formatting that might cause issues. Verify you’ve clicked the submission option.

* **Inaccurate Responses:** If the chatbot provides incorrect answers, refine the text to be more specific or add additional context.

## Document Upload

Document Upload allows you to train your chatbot by uploading files such as PDFs, markdown files, or text files. This method is ideal for integrating larger, structured content like manuals, guides, or detailed product catalogs.

### Purpose

* Use Document Upload to import pre-existing documents containing extensive or structured knowledge, saving time compared to manual text entry.

* This is especially useful for businesses with large amounts of documentation or content that needs to be digitized for chatbot use.

### Process

1. Access the Training Section:

   * Log in to Bizmo.chat and navigate to the Training section via the sidebar menu (look for the "Train" option).

   * Ensure the correct chatbot is selected in the top navigation bar.

2. Select Document Upload:

   * In the "Training Sources" area, choose the option for uploading files (typically labeled as "Files" or similar).

   * You’ll see an interface for selecting files from your device.

3. Choose and Upload Files:

   * Select supported file types, such as:

     * PDFs (e.g., user manuals, product brochures)

     * Markdown files (e.g., formatted documentation)

     * Text files (e.g., plain text reports or lists)

   * Click the upload option to add the files to Bizmo.chat. Ensure files are not corrupted and are within any size or format restrictions (refer to platform documentation if unclear).

4. Submit the Documents:

   * After uploading, use the submission option (e.g., a button labeled “Add Knowledge” or similar) to process the files.

   * The system extracts relevant text and integrates it into your chatbot’s knowledge base.

5. Monitor Progress:

   * Check the "Training Data" section to monitor character usage (e.g., out of a 10,000-character limit) and ensure you’re within limits.

   * Review the "Training Progress" section for status updates, such as “No embeddings to process” or “Your data has been processed,” indicating the documents are ready for use.

6. Finalize Training:

   * Once the documents are processed, initiate the training process using the appropriate action (e.g., a “Start” button) to make the knowledge available to your chatbot.

### Best Practices

* Format Documents Clearly: Use structured formatting (e.g., headings, bullet points) in PDFs or markdown files to help the system parse content accurately.

* Remove Irrelevant Content: Edit documents to exclude unnecessary sections, such as legal disclaimers or promotional material, to focus on useful knowledge.

* Split Large Files: If a document exceeds the character limit or is too large, break it into smaller files or extract key sections to upload separately.

* Verify File Compatibility: Ensure files are in supported formats (PDF, markdown, text) and free of encryption or password protection that might prevent processing.

### Troubleshooting

* File Not Uploading: Verify the file format is supported and not corrupted. Check for size limits or restrictions in the platform documentation.

* Character Limit Exceeded: Reduce the content in the documents or upload smaller files to stay within the 10,000-character limit.

* Incomplete Data Processing: If some content isn’t processed, ensure the file isn’t overly complex (e.g., heavily formatted or scanned PDFs). Convert to a simpler format if needed.

## Using Website Data

Website Data allows you to train your chatbot by integrating content from websites, either by crawling an entire site or targeting specific URLs. This method is ideal for pulling information directly from online resources like your company website, blog, or support pages.

### Purpose

* Use Website Data to automatically extract and incorporate content from websites, making it easy to train your chatbot with up-to-date online information.

* This is particularly useful for businesses with dynamic websites or extensive online content they want to leverage for chatbot responses.

### Process

1. Access the Training Section:

   * Log in to Bizmo.chat and navigate to the Training section via the sidebar menu (look for the "Train" option).

   * Ensure the correct chatbot is selected in the top navigation bar.

2. Select Website Data:

   * In the "Training Sources" area, choose the option for website data (typically labeled as "Website" or similar).

   * You’ll see fields or options for entering URLs and initiating a crawl.

3. Add Website Content:

   * Add Individual Link:

     * Enter a specific URL (e.g., [https://example.com/about)](https://example.com/about\)) in the provided field.

     * Use the submission option (e.g., a button labeled “Add Link” or similar) to include that page’s content in your training data.

   * Crawl a Website:

     * Enter the base URL of the website (e.g., [https://example.com)](https://example.com\)) and use the crawl option (e.g., a “Crawl” button or similar) to scan and extract content from the entire site or specified sections.

     * The system will automatically pull relevant text, navigating through linked pages as needed (depending on crawling settings).

4. Submit the Website Data:

   * After adding links or initiating a crawl, use the submission option (e.g., a button labeled “Add Knowledge” or similar) to process the website data.

   * The system extracts text and integrates it into your chatbot’s knowledge base.

5. Monitor Progress:

   * Check the "Training Data" section to monitor character usage (e.g., out of a 10,000-character limit) and ensure you’re within limits.

   * Review the "Training Progress" section for status updates, such as “No embeddings to process” or “Your data has been processed,” indicating the website data is ready for use.

6. Finalize Training:

   * Once the website data is processed, initiate the training process using the appropriate action (e.g., a “Start” button) to make the knowledge available to your chatbot.

### Best Practices

* Target Relevant Pages: Specify individual URLs or configure the crawl to focus on key pages (e.g., About, FAQ, Product pages) to avoid irrelevant content like navigation menus or advertisements.

* Limit Crawl Scope: If crawling an entire site, use settings or filters (if available) to exclude non-essential pages, reducing character usage and improving accuracy.

* Ensure Public Access: Verify that the website URLs are publicly accessible and not behind login walls or password protection, as these may prevent crawling or data extraction.

* Update Regularly: Periodically revisit website data to account for changes or updates on your site, ensuring your chatbot reflects current information.

### Troubleshooting

* URL Not Processing: Ensure the URL is correct, publicly accessible, and not blocked by robots.txt or other restrictions. Check for errors in the URL format (e.g., missing “https://”).

* Crawl Issues: If the crawl fails or incomplete data is extracted, verify the website’s structure, check for crawl limits or errors, and contact support if needed.

* Character Limit Exceeded: Reduce the scope of the crawl or remove unnecessary pages to stay within the 10,000-character limit. Focus on high-priority content if needed.
