## 1. Training the Chatbot Using Text Input

The **Text Input** method allows you to manually enter custom text-based knowledge to train your chatbot.

### Steps to Add Text-Based Knowledge

1. In the **Training Sources** section, select the **Text** tab.

2. Enter a **Knowledge Title** (a short description of the information you are adding).

3. In the text area below, **type or paste** the content you want the chatbot to learn.

4. Click **Add Knowledge** to save the text.

### Best Practices for Text Input

* Keep the content **concise and relevant** to expected user queries.

* Use **clear, structured sentences** to improve chatbot responses.

* Break down large topics into **multiple knowledge entries** for better organization.

***

## 2. Training the Chatbot Using Document Uploads

The **File Upload** method allows you to upload documents that the chatbot can extract information from.

### Supported File Types

* **PDF (.pdf)**

* **Markdown (.md)**

* **Text (.txt)**

### Steps to Upload Documents

1. Select the **Files** tab under **Training Sources**.

2. Drag and drop your files into the upload area **or** click to browse and select files.

3. The system allows uploading **up to 4 files**, each with a maximum size of **10 MB**.

4. Once the files are uploaded, the chatbot will process the content.

### Best Practices for File Uploads

* Ensure that the documents contain **clear and structured text**.

* Avoid excessive formatting, as the chatbot primarily extracts **plain text**.

* Use **separate files** for distinct topics to make retrieval more efficient.

## 3. Training the Chatbot Using Website Data

The **Website Crawling** method allows your chatbot to learn from web pages.

### **Steps to Use Website Data**

1. Click the **Website** tab in **Training Sources**.

2. Enter the **website URL** in the provided field.

3. Choose one of the following options:

   * Click **Crawl** to let the chatbot scan and extract information from the website.

   * Add specific links manually and click **Add Link** to include them as training sources.

### **Best Practices for Website Training**

* Provide URLs **that contain structured information**, such as FAQs or documentation pages.

* Avoid linking to **dynamic content** (such as login-required pages or interactive web apps).

* If only specific sections are needed, manually enter those URLs instead of crawling the entire site.

***

## Monitoring Training Data

On the right side of the **Training** page, you will see two sections:

1. **Training Data**

   * Displays the amount of data used out of the **10,000-character limit**.

2. **Training Progress**

   * Shows the number of processed training items and their status.

***

## Starting the Training Process

Once all sources have been added:

1. Click the **Start Training** button in the top-right corner.

2. The system will process the input and prepare the chatbot.

3. You can check the **Training Progress** panel for updates.
